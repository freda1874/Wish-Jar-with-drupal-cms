# WishJar: A Drupal-Based Wish-Sharing Platform
**WishJar** is a platform where users can document, share, and explore wishes to inspire and connect with others. 
Whether itâ€™s climbing a mountain, starting a business, or learning a new skill, this website provides a space to turn aspirations into inspirations.

This app was designed using Drupal as part of my journey to explore rupal development. I think Drupal offers more customization compared to WordPress.
The project is containerized using DDEV and Docker, providing a more efficient, portable development environment. I leveraged key Drupal features, including:
- Blocks and Views: To create flexible content displays.
- CSS and Twig: For custom styling and theming.I also integrated tailwindcss with twig.
- Flags: To implement functionality like "Follow User." 
- User Relationships: To manage interactions between users.
